/* boot_param_confirm: TF-M runtime (SPE) side of the A/B trial-boot handshake.
 *
 * BL2 boots a TRIAL image (boot_param_decide_slot picks update_slot) but leaves
 * the record in TRIAL: it is the running firmware's job to CONFIRM once it has
 * proven itself healthy. This module does that confirm by adopting update_slot
 * as the new exec_slot and settling the record back to NORMAL, so subsequent
 * resets boot the new slot directly (no more PMU trial-count bumps or rollback).
 *
 * The record layout and ping-pong algorithm are shared with BL2 via boot_param.h
 * (static-inline ab_record_read_latest / ab_record_commit); the flash back-end +
 * CRC32 are the shared boot_param_ops.c (boot_param_ops /
 * boot_param_partition_base). This unit only holds the SPE confirm transition. */
