/* Turning the CPU domain off for Deep-LV sleep stops the SRAM bad-point repair
 * from being applied: Reg03 mchk_valid goes 1 -> 0, so on wake a repaired word
 * reads back its raw defective cell instead of the spare it was redirected to.
 * The SRAM array itself stays retained, and so do the bad-point addresses in
 * the MEM_CHECK registers - those are still readable after the wake, which is
 * why the addresses are decoded from the registers on both passes rather than
 * kept anywhere. The registers are read-only to software, so the repair cannot
 * be re-programmed; the words it covered are read before sleep and written back
 * on wake instead. Ported from BK7236N (Jira BK7236NSW-712).
 *
 * The captured words are held in a table private to deep_lv_reserve.c, which is
 * time-shared with the deepest end of the MSP stack and therefore only valid
 * between the save below and the matching restore. */
